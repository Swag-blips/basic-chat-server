# Basic Chat Server

## Overview
This repository contains a basic chat server implemented using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. It demonstrates real-time messaging capabilities. The project is built primarily as an exercise to solidify my understanding of Socket.IO and to enhance my GitHub portfolio.

## Important Note
This project is developed by closely following the Socket.IO official documentation. It is primarily for testing my skills with Socket.IO and does not include additional functionalities beyond the basics covered in the documentation.

## Technical Setup
### Server
- **Node.js**: Runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used to build web applications and APIs.
- **Socket.IO**: JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers.

### Client
- **HTML**: The frontend is built using basic HTML.
- **Form Input**: A simple input form and submit button are used to send messages.
